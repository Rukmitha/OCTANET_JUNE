                    <h1>WHAT IS DIGITAL MARKETING?</h1>
                </center>
                <p>Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is the promotion of brands to connect with
                    potential
                    customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication. This includes not only
                    email,
                    social media, and web-based advertising, but also text and multimedia messages as a marketing
                    channel.
                </p>
                <p>Essentially, if a marketing campaign involves digital communication, it's digital marketing.</p>
                <p> Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet and online-based digital
                    technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones, and other digital media and platforms to
                    promote
                    products and services.Its development during the 1990s and 2000s changed the way brands and
                    businesses use technology for marketing. </p>
                <p>As digital platforms became increasingly incorporated into
                    marketing plans and everyday life,and as people increasingly used digital devices instead of
                    visiting physical shops,digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent, employing
                    combinations
                    of search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing,
                    influencer
                    marketing, content automation, campaign marketing, data-driven marketing, e-commerce marketing,
                    social
                    media marketing, social media optimization, e-mail direct marketing, display advertising,
                    e-books, and
                    optical disks and games have become commonplace.</p>
                <p>
                    Digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels that
                    provide digital media, such as television, mobile phones (SMS and MMS), callbacks, and on-hold
                    mobile
                    ringtones.The extension to non-Internet channels differentiates digital marketing from online
                    marketing.
